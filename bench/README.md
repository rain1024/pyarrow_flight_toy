# Comparative Benchmarks: Columns vs Rows

In this benchmark analysis (`bench_columns_vs_rows.py`), we take a comparative look at the performance of executing data operations on three different data storage formats: a Pandas DataFrame storing row-oriented data, a Pandas DataFrame storing column-oriented data, and a PyArrow Table.

We executed a specific data operation, which involved finding all customers aged between 18 and 25 across all the data structures. The objective was to measure and compare the execution time for performing this operation on these different types of data storage formats.

Here's a summary of the results:

| Data Structure                           | Execution Time (seconds)   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------:|
| Pandas DataFrame (Row-oriented)          | 4.249267                   |
| Pandas DataFrame (Column-oriented)       | 2.912263                   |
| PyArrow Table                            | 0.692972                   |

The results convey a clear performance distinction among the different data storage formats. The PyArrow Table, storing column-oriented data, documented a significantly lower execution time compared to the Pandas DataFrames, making it the most performant among the three.

This study underscores the efficiency of columnar storage formats, specifically the in-memory columnar format provided by PyArrow, which proved to be far superior to the row-oriented counterpart when executing this specific data operation. The insights drawn here underscore the essence of considering the right data structure - a crucial factor that can greatly influence data operation efficiency, particularly crucial when dealing with large-scale data management and analytics.
